Unofficial DarkRP Leveling System
======================
This is not the official DarkRP Leveling System by Vrondakis. I will be keeping this up to date and constantly putting out new features.

This leveling system is for DarkRP v2.7.x.  Adds leveling functionality and allows you to limit item purchasing based on players level.


Features
-------
**Database Support** - This script integrates directly into DarkRP's database. Works with SQLite and MySQL. (No changes needed)

**Gemstone Printers** - Implemented Gemstone Printers into the leveling system! Printers store mkoney and experience. They require coolant to function.

**Experience Books** - Experience books grants players experience. Can be purchased with DarkRP money.

**HUD** - The HUD looks good and provides level infomation to players. The XP bar is animated, and fits right in!

**Easy Installation** - Drag and drop into Addons folder.

**Multiple Admin Mod Support** - Allows you to set levels and experience with ULX, SAM, and ServerGuard.

**Configuration File** - An all in one configuration file allowing you to easily change everything.

**Supports future versions of DarkRP** - This script doesn't edit any of DarkRP's core files, so you don't have to worry about reinstalling the script when you update.
